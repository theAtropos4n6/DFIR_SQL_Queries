# SQL_DFIR_Queries
A collection of small queries I assemble during my investigations. I hope they help you as they did with me.

#Why do we need custom queries when we have our forensic super software you ask? 

Well, forensic tools do not always parse properly the artifacts. Sometimes, the artifacts of interest are not properly parsed/decoded and you have to manually do the work. This is exactly where you can use these queries. 

Do share with your colleagues, as sharing is what makes our DFIR family great. Cheers!
